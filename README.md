# Getting Started with Create React App

This is a twitter clone made with react. It is designed to work with a [pre-existing back-end API](https://github.com/makersacademy/chitter_api_backend). The prupose of this project is to consolidate and build on my knowledge of React, to learn Bottstrap, and to try understand more about integration and unit testing React components using Jest.
